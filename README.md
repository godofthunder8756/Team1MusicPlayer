# Neural Enhancer 1000

A small test of the immersion algorithm that generates binaural beats and isochronic tones for immersion. The best way to observe this is to watch the Freq variable approach 8, the maximum amplitude of the binaural wave and note your emotional investment in the song. Note things like relaxation and immersion and let me know what you think. This is just a functioning demo that will have a better UI later.

Freq Shift:      Brain Wave Influence:

0                Normal

1-3              Delta (deep, dreamless sleep)

4-6              Theta (dreaming, 'auto pilot' state)

6-8              Alpha (relax and recharge)

8+               Beta and Gamma --damages audio--
